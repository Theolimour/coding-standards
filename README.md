## Coding Standards

### General Guidelines
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent formatting and style throughout the codebase.
- **Readability**: Write code that is easy to read and understand.
- **Documentation**: Comment your code where necessary to explain complex logic.
- **Testing**: Write tests for new features and bug fixes.

### Naming Conventions
- **Variables**: Use camelCase for variable names (e.g., `myVariable`).
- **Functions**: Use camelCase for function names (e.g., `myFunction`).
- **Classes**: Use PascalCase for class names (e.g., `MyClass`).
- **Constants**: Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants (e.g., `MY_CONSTANT`).

### Code Structure
- **Files**: Organize files by feature or module.
- **Functions**: Keep functions small and focused on a single task.
- **Classes**: Use classes to encapsulate related data and behavior.

### Formatting and Style
- **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces for indentation.
- **Line Length**: Limit lines to 80 characters.
- **Braces**: Use braces for all control structures, even single-line statements.
- **Whitespace**: Use blank lines to separate logical sections of code.

### Best Practices
- **Avoid Global Variables**: Minimize the use of global variables to reduce dependencies.
- **Error Handling**: Handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages.
- **Code Reviews**: Participate in code reviews to maintain code quality.
- **Refactoring**: Regularly refactor code to improve its structure and readability.

## Contribution Guidelines
- **Pull Requests**: Submit pull requests for all changes.
- **Code Reviews**: All changes must be reviewed and approved before merging.
- **Issue Tracking**: Use issue tracking to report and manage bugs and feature requests.
